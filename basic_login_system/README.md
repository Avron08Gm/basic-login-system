#BASIC LOGIN SYSTEM

This repository is regarding making a simple login system using only PHP and HTML.

**FOR RUNNING THESE PHP SCRIPTS AND HTML TOGETHER, YOU NEED TO HAVE XAMPP INSTALLED IN YOUR PC**

The file '*basic_login_system*' should be present inside the 'htdocs' of the 'xampp' folder. And **before opening the localhost, the Apache and the MySQL modules needs to be turned on via the XAMPP control panel.**
